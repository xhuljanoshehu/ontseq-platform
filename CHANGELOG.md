# Changelog

All notable changes to this research software are recorded here. The project has no clinically
validated release.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Reframed the architecture as an independent, evidence-led implementation.
- Reclassified the thesis as historical context rather than a technical specification.
- Replaced unvalidated CNV/SV defaults with benchmark-gated candidate sets.
- Added mandatory coverage, tumor/blast-fraction and no-call validation axes.
- Bumped the research software foundation to version 0.2.0.
- HTML and Excel reports now expose explicit per-module execution status.

### Added

- Living literature and benchmark evidence base with explicit applicability and limitations.
- Fail-closed aligned-BAM/BAI/header/reference intake gate using samtools.
- Versioned reference locks generated from FASTA index files.
- Cramino JSON adapter with normalized, path-free descriptive QC.
- Deterministic normalized-event CNV/SV benchmark engine and synthetic fixtures.
- Snakemake entry points for the aligned-BAM MVP and synthetic benchmarks.

### Validation impact

The report schema and workbook gain module-status data. Aligned-BAM intake can now stop a run on
technical incompatibility. No scientific caller has been promoted to a production or clinical
default; CNV/SV/fusion output remains `NOT_RUN` in the MVP.
