# Changelog

All notable changes to this research software are recorded here. The project has no clinically
validated release.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Canonical GRCh37/GRCh38 reference validation at the Desktop setup boundary.
- FAI-dictionary-addressed reference identities, atomic lock publication, exact BAM-index
  verification and content-addressed intake signatures covering BAM, BAI, reference lock,
  pipeline version and Git commit.
- Actionable, path-free sequence-dictionary mismatch diagnostics retained after failed intake.
- Machine-readable panel promotion blockers and consistent `IGH_REVIEW_REQUIRED` labelling
  across the BED and descriptive expectations table.

### Validation impact

The aligned-BAM gate remains strict. These changes prevent a partial or wrong-build FAI from
being configured as a complete named reference and prevent resume from reusing intake after
BAM, index, lock or code changes. Dictionary compatibility is still not base-level FASTA
identity. The 111 entries are target intervals, not a clinically validated gene count; the
panel remains `derived_unconfirmed` and must not support a negative or reportable claim.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Per-run component selection: a `RunComponents` document names the provider and the exact
  tool version for each stage that runs an external program. The version is checked against
  the tool's own probe before the stage executes, and a mismatch fails that stage naming
  both versions. Deselected stages are recorded as `NOT_RUN` with the selection named.
- `configs/components/default.yaml` and `configs/components/legacy_sniffles_2.4.yaml`, plus
  a Sniffles 2.4.0 policy, so the structural-variant component of the historical pipeline
  can be reproduced for comparison without editing code.
- Target coverage is wired into the canonical runner as `StageId.TARGET_COVERAGE`. An
  adaptive-sampling run without a target-coverage policy now fails closed instead of
  recording the assay's central QC as absent; a non-adaptive run records that the stage does
  not apply, which is a scope statement rather than a coverage result.
- `AssaySpec.target_bed_role`, distinguishing an unbuffered analysis ROI from a buffered
  selection panel, and carried into the target-coverage report and its limitations.
- First non-synthetic target design: a 111-target, 17.03 Mb buffered GRCh38 panel under
  `configs/panels/`, with a lock file, a reproducible generator script and de-identified
  per-target coverage expectations. Provenance and open questions in
  `docs/PANEL_PROVENANCE.md`.
- Tests cover per-target coverage inside a run envelope, lcWGS out-of-scope behaviour and
  fail-closed handling of a component pinned to an unavailable version.
- `docs/COMPONENT_SELECTION.md` and `docs/LEGACY_COMPARISON.md`, the latter mapping the
  historical pipeline's outputs onto this one and proposing MOLM13 as the first positive
  control.
- Version-locked Mosdepth target-coverage adapter for Adaptive Sampling aligned-BAM runs.
- Strict target-BED and Mosdepth output normalization with exact interval reconciliation,
  per-region mean depth and configurable threshold fractions.
- Dedicated technical policy for target coverage and a synthetic real-tool CI path.
- Documentation that separates the unbuffered analysis ROI BED from operational Adaptive
  Sampling selection regions.

### Changed

- `ontseq` with no command lists both command groups. Execution commands were previously
  invisible to `--help`.

### Validation impact

Adaptive-sampling runs now produce per-target coverage as part of the canonical run rather
than only through a separate command. The default `1x`, `10x`, `20x` and `30x` thresholds
remain engineering bins only and do not define assay adequacy, CNV or fusion reportability,
biological negativity or a clinical no-call.

The coverage expectations table is a sanity reference derived from historical runs; it is
not an adequacy gate, not a reportability threshold and not a no-call definition. The panel
is `derived_unconfirmed`: it is reconstructed from laboratory coverage tables rather than
copied from the selection file used at sequencing time, and one target label contradicts its
coordinates.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Typed Sniffles2 policy and call-report contracts with generated JSON Schemas.
- Conservative Sniffles2 v2.8.0 adapter using shell-free execution, symbolic VCF and PASS-only
  normalization with filter-reason accounting.
- Defensive DEL/DUP/INV/INS/BND normalization with counted rejection reasons and `NO_CALL`.
- Runtime-generated synthetic long-read BAM fixture and real samtools/Cramino/Sniffles2 smoke test.
- CI job with a pinned Bioconda environment and selected raw-data-free reviewer artifacts.
- Candidate SV evidence in the common JSON, HTML and Excel result path.

### Changed

- Extended evidence provenance with supporting-read strands, coverage context and mean alignment
  NM.
- Connected the aligned-BAM Snakemake DAG to the candidate-only Sniffles2 adapter.
- Bumped the research software foundation to version 0.3.0.

### Validation impact

The aligned-BAM path can now change biological candidate output by executing Sniffles2. Every
normalized event is forced to `unclassified` and `reportable: false`; BND is not treated as a
fusion, and ISCN remains `NOT_RUN`. The included thresholds are engineering defaults only. This
change requires locked HG002/HG008 and intended-use AML validation before any promotion.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Reframed the architecture as an independent, evidence-led implementation.
- Reclassified the thesis as historical context rather than a technical specification.
- Replaced unvalidated CNV/SV defaults with benchmark-gated candidate sets.
- Added mandatory coverage, tumor/blast-fraction and no-call validation axes.
- Bumped the research software foundation to version 0.2.0.
- HTML and Excel reports now expose explicit per-module execution status.

### Added

- Living literature and benchmark evidence base with explicit applicability and limitations.
- Fail-closed aligned-BAM/BAI/header/reference intake gate using samtools.
- Versioned reference locks generated from FASTA index files.
- Cramino JSON adapter with normalized, path-free descriptive QC.
- Deterministic normalized-event CNV/SV benchmark engine and synthetic fixtures.
- Snakemake entry points for the aligned-BAM MVP and synthetic benchmarks.

### Validation impact

The report schema and workbook gain module-status data. Aligned-BAM intake can now stop a run on
technical incompatibility. No scientific caller has been promoted to a production or clinical
default; CNV/SV/fusion output remains `NOT_RUN` in the MVP.
