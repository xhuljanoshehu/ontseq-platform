# Architecture decision log

## ADR-001: Keep computation local by default

**Decision:** Raw and derived human genomic data remain on approved institutional compute.

**Reason:** Genomic files are sensitive and potentially identifying. Cloud orchestration is
metadata-only unless explicitly approved.

## ADR-002: Use Snakemake for the initial workflow

**Decision:** Preserve the file-oriented Snakemake architecture used in the thesis.

**Reason:** It maps naturally to the existing rule structure, supports isolated environments,
parallel branches and reproducible tests, and minimizes rewrite risk.

## ADR-003: Use one normalized event model

**Decision:** HTML, Excel, JSON and ISCN proposals are rendered from the same validated
event model.

**Reason:** Parallel report logic causes silent discrepancies. One source of truth makes each
displayed result traceable to caller evidence.

## ADR-004: Treat ISCN as a proposal until validated

**Decision:** No automated notation can be released without expert review.

**Reason:** Syntax alone does not establish semantic correctness, clonality, uncertainty or
clinical validity.
